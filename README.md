# Othello

As a side project to hone my programming skills, I aim to develop a fully functional Othello game application. The primary objectives include enabling local co-op gameplay on the same computer and implementing an AI opponent for single-player mode.

# Technologies & Features
  Frontend: React will serve as the frontend framework, providing a dynamic and interactive user interface.
  Backend: Java will power the backend logic, handling game mechanics and player interactions.
  Database: PostgreSQL will be utilized for efficient data management, storing game states and player information.
  Containerization: Docker will facilitate seamless integration between the frontend and backend components, streamlining deployment and scalability.
  AI Opponent: Incorporating Alpha-Beta pruning, the AI opponent will be capable of making strategic decisions to challenge players in single-player mode.
